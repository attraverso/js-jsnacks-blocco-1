### Project requirements:

1. snack5 - Ask the user for a number (n), then log to console the cube of every number from 1 to n.
2. snack6 - Keep logging to console 2 to the power of n, incrementing n by 1 on every iteration until the result is higher than 1000.

### Extra features:

- added a version that prints all results  until 2 ** 1000
- added a version where the base number and the limit are defined by the user

### Goals:

- Practice for loops and conditional statements
- Practice logical thinking and the process of giving step-by-step instructions to a machine.
